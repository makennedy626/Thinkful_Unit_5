DRILL: When to use surveys
State whether a survey would be the best option for answering each of the following questions.

Popularity of various Uber drivers. - View their ratings (which is pretty much a quick survey after each trip)
A grocery store wants to know how much people like strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream. - View purchases of the three types and compare
Trojan wants to know whether their condoms are more popular among straight people or gay people. - Survey
Recently, rental rates for HappyCars have increased by 30%, which is quite unusual. You want to find out why this is happening and how to keep the increase going. - Find out what else is going on that might cause an increase in rental cars overall (like more travel to your location recently). Use a survey to see how people heard about HappyCars.
Assessing the success rate of a new advertising campaign. - If it is an online ad, measure click-through rate. Otherwise, offer a discount through the ad that the customer needs to put in when shopping.
Measuring the effect of nurse/patient ratio on patient recovery rates in hospital wards. - You do not need a survey for this. The hospital should have data on the recovery rate and the amount of nurses assigned.
